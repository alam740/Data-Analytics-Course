# Data-Analytics-Course
This repository contains a collection of Google Colab sandboxes related to the course on  "Principles of Data Analytics, Design of Experiments, and Machine Learning" There are 15 lectures for the course. Each lecture has its own sandbox. There is a sandbox for the weekly homework as well. The goal is to allow the students practice various examples so that they have an intuitive understanding of the examples being discussed.
